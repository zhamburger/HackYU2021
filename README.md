# HackYU2021

Our team's mission is to streamline and evolve how learning is conducted in a virtual classroom setting. During the hackathon, our team developed two new technologies. The first being “Transit” a text converter that translates text to emojis. The second "Speakit" a translator that can take a speaker's monologue (both videochat and in-person) and creates a transcript of this text to translate it into any language.

## Transit
Most educational institutions require a certain level of literacy from their students. However, students entering kindergarten or preschool have no prior experience reading or writing. Teachers employ different strategies to help students develop these skills, such as pictures, educational videos, picture books, and many more. The underlying similarity between these strategies is incorporating visual stimuli to convey more abstract ideas. This is why elementary school classrooms are usually full of pictures and picture books. With the emergence of new technologies, the need for classrooms has diminished, but the need for visuals aids in the education system has not. 

Bridging the gap between technology and visual learning is what "Transit" is out to accomplish. "Transit" allows teachers and students to log into class virtually via video chat. It then allows each student to choose their preferred language. While the teacher is speaking, it transcribes live subtitles from any language to the students' preferred one. This removes language barriers in classrooms and allows students to download the transcription after class, so they won't get distracted when taking notes.

The primary functionality of "Transit" is its "emoji" mode. Emoticons have become a popular way of expressing emotions and ideas through texts. Since emoticons can be excellent visual stimuli, "Transit" incorporates this into the transcription.  If the professor turns on this mode, emoticons will replace any word that is associated with it. This allows visual learning in virtual classrooms and after class using the downloaded notes.

## Speakit
Our team built a video streaming platform which has a Closed Caption subtitle program to aid non native speakers and deaf students to follow their lectures in real-time. The teacher's speech will be translated to any language	and appear under the speaker so that the viewers can follow along. The transcript can also be downloaded if the user wishes.

As well as the video aspect, there is an in-person aspect as well. While this program is running in an in-person class, the program can parse everything the professor says and creates a transcript of their lesson in any language. Additionally, this transcript can be saved directly to Microsoft Word so that students can use this program as a note-taker which ensures that no key information is lost.
